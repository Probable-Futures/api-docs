# Probable Futures Developer Documentation

## Background

Probable Futures aims to increase our chances that the future is good. It is an unconventional initiative that brings together leaders across culture, business, technology, and design, in collaboration with scientists at Woodwell Climate Research Center. It is not a business and does not pursue financial profit.

We offer tools to visualize climate change along with stories and insights to help people understand what those changes mean. We offer these without cost or compensation.

Our public website, [probablefutures.org](https://probablefutures.org), offers interactive maps, science, historical context, and stories to help us all envision a range of climate futures. It is intended to be accessible and useful for anyone with an internet connection.

These docs and the resources described in them are intended for software developers or anyone with web development know-how and an interest in creating online tools or resources with predictive climate model data.
