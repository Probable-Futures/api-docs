# How to interpret low, mid, and high values

The `lowValue`, `midValue`, and `highValue` are points on a distribution of outcomes. The low and high values not the lowest or highest possible values that could occur in the specified location at a specified warming scenario but are points on a range which goes beyond these low and high points. For some Probable Futures maps, the low and high are 10th and 90th percentile values and for others they are 5th and 95th percentile values. In other words, for maps with 10th and 90th, the low and high should be expected on average once every ten years but can certainly happen more than once in any specific ten year period. Also, since 20% of the values fall outside of the 10th and 90th percentile, lower lows and higher highs will certainly occur as well. For 5th and 95th, 10% of thevalues fall outside of the the values. So, for these maps, the low and high values should be expected once in every twenty years on average but lower lowers and higher highs will certainly occur as well.
