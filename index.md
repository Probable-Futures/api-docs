# Probable Futures Developer Resources
Welcome! If you are here, you are among the first to see this documentation and the resources described in it. We are actively adding to it and making more resources available. For now, a minimal version of an API is available and documented.

## Background

Probable Futures aims to increase our chances that the future is good. We offer resources to help people understand the implications of climate changes.

Our public website, [probablefutures.org](https://probablefutures.org), offers interactive maps, science, historical context, and stories to help us all envision a range of climate futures. It is intended to be accessible and useful for anyone with an internet connection.

These docs and the resources described in them are intended for software developers or anyone with web development know-how and an interest in creating online tools or resources with predictive climate model data.  

## Before you begin building

Before creating anything with Probable Futures data or maps, we strongly recommend reading all four volumes on [probablefutures.org](probablefutures.org/): Heat, Water, Land, and Onward. These four volumes are essential context for creating applications using Probable Futures data.

## What is Probable Futures?
Probable Futures is an unconventional initiative that brings together leaders across culture, business, technology, and design and scientists at Woodwell Climate Research Center. It is not a business and does not pursue financial profit. To learn more, visit [probablefutures.org/about](https://probablefutures.org/about).
