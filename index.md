# Probable Futures Developer Resources
Welcome! These docs describe the Probable Futures developer resources such as the Probable Futures API, maps, and more.

All resources are different ways of accessing or visualizing the same datasets. The datasets are global, high-resolution modeled climate scenarios, publicly available as maps on [probablefutures.org/maps](https://probablefutures.org/maps).

By understanding these scenarios, anyone can prepare for the futures that are likely and work to avoid the ones that carry the most profound risks for our world.

## Background

Probable Futures is a non-profit climate literacy initiative that makes practical tools, stories, and resources available online to everyone, everywhere. We offer educational materials and data tools to empower individuals, organizations, and governments to prepare for the futures that are likely, and work to avoid the ones that carry the most profound risks for our world.

Before creating anything with Probable Futures data or maps, we strongly recommend reading all four volumes on [probablefutures.org](https://probablefutures.org/): Heat, Water, Land, and Onward. These four volumes are essential context for creating applications using Probable Futures data. The [five-minute video on the origin of civilization and the importance of stability](https://probablefutures.org/stability) is a good place to start.
