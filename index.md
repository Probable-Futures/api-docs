# Probable Futures Developer Resources
Welcome! These developer resources offer documentation about the Probable Futures API, maps, tilesets, and raw data which are different ways of accessing or visualizing the same underlying datasets. The datasets are global, high-resolution modeled climate scenarios. They can be used to prepare for the futures that are likely, and work to avoid the ones that carry the most profound risks for our world.

## Background

Probable Futures is a non-profit climate literacy initiative that makes practical tools, stories, and resources available online to everyone, everywhere. We offer educational materials and data tools to empower individuals, organizations, and governments to prepare for the futures that are likely, and work to avoid the ones that carry the most profound risks for our world.

Before creating anything with Probable Futures data or maps, we strongly recommend reading all four volumes on [probablefutures.org](https://probablefutures.org/): Heat, Water, Land, and Onward. These four volumes are essential context for creating applications using Probable Futures data. The [five-minute video on the origin of civilization and the importance of stability](https://probablefutures.org/stability) is a good place to start.
