# Probable Futures Developer Documentation
Welcome! These docs describe how to use the Probable Futures developer resources which include the Probable Futures maps, tilesets, API, raw data, and more.

## Expected background

Before creating anything with Probable Futures data or maps, we strongly recommend reading all three volumes on [probablefutures.org](https://probablefutures.org/): Heat, Water, and Land. These volumes provide essential context for creating applications using Probable Futures maps and data. The [five-minute video on the origin of civilization and the importance of stability](https://probablefutures.org/stability) is a good place to start.

## About Probable Futures
