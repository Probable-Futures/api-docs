# Ways to access our data

Our data is designed to be accessed and used in many ways, such as:

1.  **Using the API**

    By using our API you can receive climate model data for any place in the world. Follow the instructions in [API access](./api-access.md) for information on how to get access to the API. More instructions about how to use the API can be found in [calling the API](./calling-the-api.md).

2.  **Using the map style JSON files**

    If you want to use Mapbox Studio or Mapbox APIs to create your own maps, you can try this method. Visit [our public docs repo on Github](https://github.com/Probable-Futures/docs/tree/main/mapStyles) to find JSON files containing the styles for each map. These files can be imported into your Mapbox account allowing you to customize the maps by adding or removing layers according to your requirements. Here are the steps:

    -   Sign up or sign in to your Mapbox account
    -   Go to the styles page in [Mapbox studio](https://studio.mapbox.com/)
    -   Click the "New style" button, and a modal will appear
    -   Click the "Upload Style" button at the top of the modal
    -   Click "Select a file" to select one of the JSON files you downloaded from the documentation repository
    -   Finally click the "Customize" button to view and edit the map

3.  **Getting the data as CSV files**

    By signing in to [Probable Futures Pro](https://probablefutures.org/pro/), you gain access to advanced features including the ability to download datasets for all maps as CSV files. You can either download the complete data for a specific map or choose to download data for a particular country. Follow the steps:

    -   [Request access to Probable Futures Pro](https://airtable.com/shrOMfMgh7EoHajKN)
    -   After siging in, go to the [datasets page](https://pro.probablefutures.org/dashboard/datasets)
    -   Scroll down to find a list of all the Probable Futures maps
    -   Click the "Download" button next to the dataset you want to download
    -   By default, all data is selected and you can click "Download" to begin downloading the full map dataset. If you would like to download data for a specific country, select the country in the dropdown. You can also select the columns to include in the CSV file.

4.  **Request access to the NetCDF files**

    Originally, the data is in NetCDF format. Please [contact us](https://probablefutures.org/contact/) if you'd like the data in this format.
