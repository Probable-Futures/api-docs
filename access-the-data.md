## Ways to access our data

Our data is designed to be accessed and used in many ways, such as:

1. **Using the API**

    By using our API you can receive climate model data for any place in the world. Follow the instructions in [API access](./api-access.md) for information on how to get access to the API. More instructions about how to use the API can be found in [calling the API](./calling-the-api.md).

2. **Using Mapbox Studio**

    This is a fast and easy way to get started with Probable Futures maps. Go to the [Mapbox quick-start page](./mapbox-quick-start.md) and follow the instructions there to begin.

3. **Getting the data as CSV files**

    By signing in to [Probable Futures Pro](https://probablefutures.org/pro/), you gain access to advanced features including the ability to download datasets for all maps as CSV files. You can either download the complete data for a specific map or choose to download data for a particular country. Follow the steps:

    - After signing in, go to the [datasets page](https://pro.probablefutures.org/dashboard/datasets)
    - Scroll down to find a list of all the Probable Futures maps
    - Click the "Download" button next to the dataset you want to download
    - By default, all data is selected and you can click "Download" to begin downloading the full map dataset. If you would like to download data for a specific country, select the country in the dropdown. You can also select the columns to include in the CSV file.

4. **Request access to the NetCDF files**

    Originally, the data is in NetCDF format. Please [contact us](https://probablefutures.org/contact/) if you'd like the data in this format.
