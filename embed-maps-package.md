# @probable-futures/probable-futures-maps

This package empowers developers to seamlessly integrate dynamic and interactive climate maps into their web applications

## When should it be used

Depending on your case, downloading the embeddable maps one by one from the [probablefutures.org](https://probablefutures.org/maps) site my not be ideal. Therefore, we built this npm package to target developers who want to quickly and dynamically integrate the Probable Futures maps into their own web applications.

This package offers functions to create embeddable maps as HTML string templates. These templates can be rendered on your website using your preferred tools and functionalities, such as "iframes".
