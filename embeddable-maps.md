# Embeddable maps

With embeddable maps, anyone can easily embed any Probable Futures map in a website without touching a single line of code.

Available for all Probable Futures maps at all six warming scenarios, embeddable maps can:

- Add clear and compelling visual maps of our changing climate to any website, article, story, or app
- Show any place in the world, at any zoom level
- Do the above for a single warming scenario or multiple, in comparison or sequentially

## How to use embeddable maps

1. Go to [probablefutures.org/maps](https://probablefutures.org/maps).
2. Navigate the map to a place in the world that you would like to show in the embeddable map.
3. Click the download button on the top right.
4. Select "Download as embeddable map" or "Download as embeddable comparison map". If selecting a standard embeddable map, the warming scenario you are viewing will be shown in the embeddable map. If selecting a comparison map, choose the warming scenarios you would like to include in the embeddable map in the next step.
5. Click the download button to download the embeddable map file.
6. Add the file to any website, application, or article.
