# Mapbox quick start

Start working with Probable Futures maps in less than five minutes with this simple guide.  

We will use [Mapbox Studio](studio.mapbox.com) to quickly get started with a Mapbox's excellent visual map editing experience. If you don't have a Mapbox account, you will need to create one to use Mapbox Studio.

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Download a Mapbox style JSON file from the Probable Futures [map styles folder in Github](https://github.com/Probable-Futures/docs/tree/main/mapStyles).
2. On the [Mapbox Studio styles page](studio.mapbox.com), click the "New style" button. Then click the "Upload Style" tab.
3. Upload the JSON file you downloaded from the Probable Futures map styles folder in Github.

## How it works
The Mapbox Style JSON contains all the styles (colors, layers, etc.) and references to the Probable Futures tilesets, which contain the actual climate data.

The Probable Futures tilesets are public in Mapbox so anyone can use Mapbox styles to make a map using Probable Futures data by referencing the the appropriate tilset IDs for a given map. Visit the [tilesets page](./tilesets.md) to learn more about Probable Futures tilesets.
