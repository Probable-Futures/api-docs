## Important Definitions to Know Working with Probable Futures

*Warming/Climate Scenarios*: Measured in units of 0.5°C, each warming scenario is a model of the climate at the given temperature increase. A more detailed explanation can be found on [Understanding climate scenarios](/understanding-climate-scenarios.md).

*Statistical Percentiles & Range of Values*: On Probable Futures Maps and the Probable Futures API, data points are represented by a low, mid, and high value.  
| PF Value | Percentile Value| Explanation |
| ---------| ----------------| ------------|
| Low      | 5th | These conditions should be expected in approximately 5% of possible scenarios. At the low end of the range of possibilities. |
| Mid      | 50th (Median) or Mean Value*| Conditions near this value should be expected in a typical year. Expected in approximately 50% of possible scenarios. |
| High     | 95th | These conditions should be expected in approximately 5% of possible scenarios - at the high end of the range of possiblilties. |

*See [Note on average and median values](/probable-futures-data#note-on-average-and-median-values.md)

*Grid Cells*: The [climate models we use](https://probablefutures.org/science/climate-models/) split the world into a grid and model the climate within each grid cell. Probable Futures maps have a resolution of 0.2° latitude and longitude per side of each grid cell which is approximately the size of a typical city’s metro area. This is the most specific data available on Probable Futures currently. [More](/probable-futures-data#journey-of-the-data.md)
