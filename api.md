# The API

The Probable Futures API is a GraphQL API. We originally created the API for our own use on probablefutures.org and various other experimental mapping tools.

We are now in the early stages of making the API available for others to use. This documentation describes how to access and use the API.

We have only made certain queries available for now but we welcome feedback and ideas about other queries or API structures that would be useful.
