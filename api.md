# The API

The Probable Futures API is a GraphQL API. We originally created the API to support probablefutures.org and [Probable Futures Pro](https://probablefutures.org/pro/). Now, we are making it available for anyone to use.

For now, credentials are required to use the API but we are happy to share credentials with anyone. To request access, please [fill out this form](https://airtable.com/shrOMfMgh7EoHajKN). We will get back to you quickly.
