# About the data

Climate describes conditions that occur over seasons and years. Therefore, climate can be described in probabilistic terms: Many places near the equator are very likely to have daytime temperatures reach at least 32°C (90°F) for three months every year. Other places are very unlikely to have so many months with such daytime temperatures. Similarly, the same place near the equator may be very unlikely to have any nights reach freezing temperatures, but it still may happen from time to time. You will encounter values representing these probabilities in the API.

As the global climate changes, the range of probabilities for heat, precipitation, and dryness change as well. The Probable Futures data available in this API offer insight into this range of probable conditions by sending queries for six warming scenarios. More warming scenarios may be added in the future.

Warming scenarios are typically measured and referred to in Celsius such as 1°C, 1.5°C, and 2°C of global average temperature rise since pre-industrial times. These small-sounding numbers appear incremental but represent substantially different climates. Every increase in global temperature has implications for local and regional weather, natural systems, and society. So how can we prepare for the climate futures that are likely, and avoid the ones that carry the most profound risks for our world?

Before creating anything with this API, we recommend reading all four volumes on ProbableFutures.org: Heat, Water, Land, and Onward. The interactive maps, science, historical context, and stories are essential context for creating applications using Probable Futures data.

Examples of how the data in this API can be visualized can be seen in the public maps application located at [probablefutures.org/maps](probablefutures.org/maps).
