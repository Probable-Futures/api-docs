# About the data

Probable Futures data are climate model data. Climate models are created and maintained by scientific institutions around the world which make their models available for download. Although these models have technically been publicly available for a long time, downloading and using them requires so much specialized climate science knowledge that they have remained only available for scientists. Probable Futures makes climate models available to anyone, anywhere.

Our climate science partner, Woodwell Climate Research Center, downloads and prepares the data in a format commonly used for cliamte data called NetCDF. Because NetCDF files are not web-ready, we built a parser to read these files, process and format the data inside, and feed the datasets into our database. After that we create GeoJSON files which we use to create tilesets and styles using the Mapbox tiling service.

Before using them in this way, however, it is important to understand how scientists make the models, how they are meant to be used, and their strengths and weaknesses. This section covers these topics and will empower you to use data produced by climate models in an informed and risk-aware manner.

## What climate models do

Scientists created climate models to better understand how the climate would change in response to changes in the composition of the atmosphere. At their most basic level, these models are based on fundamental laws of physics, simulate proven physical dynamics that govern atmospheric behavior, and reproduce patterns in observed data. Climate models simulate properties and processes across the full Earth system, including land, glaciers, forests, oceans, and the atmosphere.

## Climate and weather

The climate is a set of conditions that hold over seasons and years, while weather is made up of short-term atmospheric outcomes that can change within a day. Climate is expressed in ranges and averages, while weather is a precise phenomenon at a specific time in a specific place. Climate models thus offer helpful information about the trajectory and magnitude of climate outcomes for given changes in the atmosphere, but they are not meant to make precise predictions.

## Warming scenarios

Any given change in the atmosphere toward an increasing global average temperature may be referred to as a warming scenario.

As the climate changes, the ranges and averages that can be expected at a local, regional, and global level change as well. Because the climate system is complex, an increase in global average temperature results in a wide range of changes in heat, precipitation, and dryness. Developing foresight into these wide-ranging changing conditions offers an opportunity to take action to manage the unavoidable and avoid the unmanageable range of futures we now face.

The Probable Futures data and maps offer insight into this range of probable conditions for six warming scenarios: two that are now in the past, one that is probable in the coming years, and three that are possible but currently avoidable. More warming scenarios may be added to the Probable Futures data and maps in the future.

Warming scenarios are typically measured and referred to in increments of global average temperature rise since pre-industrial global average temperature, which for the purpose of climate science and policy is typically considered 1850-1900.

Celsius is typically used as the unit for warming scenarios. Changes in global average temperature of even 0.5°C represent substantially different climates so common increments of warming scenarios include 1°C, 1.5°C, and 2°C. The Probable Futures warming scenarios include 0.5°C, 1°C, 1.5°C, 2°C, 2.5°C, and 3°C. These small-sounding numbers may appear incremental but every increase in global temperature has implications for local and regional weather, natural systems, and society.

## When are warming scenarios?

It is common to wonder when warming scenarios have occurred in the past or will occur in the future. Although it is not possible to assign specific dates to specific warming scenarios without making assumptions about other factors such as the amount of warming gasses that humans will add to the atmosphere in the future, it is possible to predict a range of years when certain warming scenarios may be reached given current rates of emissions. It is also possible to identify when past warming scenarios occurred.

The following sentences describe when warming scenarios have happened in the past and the range of years when future warming scenarios may be reached in the future.

### 0.5°C warming scenario

The average surface temperature between 1971 and 2000 was approximately 0.5°C above that of 1850-1900.

### 1.0°C warming scenario

In 2017 the average surface temperature passed 1.0°C above the 1850-1900 average. Humans have only experienced higher temperatures during a brief period 120,000 years ago. Major biotic changes, including release of greenhouse gasses from thawing permafrost, forest fires, and collapse of Arctic sea ice, have begun contributing to further warming.

### 1.5°C warming scenario

Reaching 1.5°C is likely by 2030, and the probability of stopping warming below 1.5°C is approaching zero. Standards and expectations based on the past are rapidly becoming outdated. Heat, drought, deluge, and other stresses will increase, and large-scale biotic feedbacks are likely to intensify.

### 2.0°C warming scenario

The probability of staying below 2.0°C of warming is falling quickly. On the current path of emissions, 2.0°C will likely be passed in the 2040s. However, rapid, dramatic action to get to zero emissions can substantially lengthen the time before reaching 2.0°C, giving society and nature more time to adapt, prepare, and innovate.

### 2.5°C warming scenario

Rapid, dramatic action to get to zero emissions can substantially reduce the probability of reaching 2.5°C. On the current path, 2.5°C will likely be passed in the 2050s. The earth was last this warm nearly 3 million years ago, when there were no land-based ice sheets other than on Antarctica and Greenland. Stabilizing temperatures at 2.5°C would likely require humans to perpetually offset biotic sources of warming.

### 3.0°C warming scenario

If we act rapidly to get to zero emissions and find ways to increase carbon stores, we can make reaching 3.0°C a low probability. On the current path of emissions, 3.0°C will likely be passed in the 2060s. At 3.0°C, most regions of the Earth would have entered a different climate, causing severe biological disruptions. The climate is extremely unlikely to be stable at this temperature.
