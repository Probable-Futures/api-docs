# About the data

This documentation describes how to interact with climate model data.

Climate models can be a useful tool for real-world decision-making. Before using them in this way, however, it is important to understand how scientists make the models, how they are meant to be used, and their strengths and weaknesses. This section covers these topics and will empower you to use data produced by climate models in an informed and risk-aware manner.

## What climate models do
Scientists created climate models to better understand how the climate would change in response to changes in the composition of the atmosphere. At their most basic level, these models are based on fundamental laws of physics, simulate proven physical dynamics that govern atmospheric behavior, and reproduce patterns in observed data. Climate models simulate properties and processes across the full Earth system, including land, glaciers, forests, oceans, and the atmosphere.

## Climate and weather
The climate is a set of conditions that hold over seasons and years, while weather is made up of short-term atmospheric outcomes that can change within a day. Climate is expressed in ranges and averages, while weather is a precise phenomenon at a specific time in a specific place. Climate models thus offer helpful information about the trajectory and magnitude of climate outcomes for given changes in the atmosphere, but they are not meant to make precise predictions.

## Warming scenarios
As the global climate changes, the ranges and averages for heat, precipitation, and dryness change as well. The data described here offer insight into this range of probable conditions by making queries available for six warming scenarios and all Probable Futures maps. More warming scenarios may be added in the future.

Warming scenarios are typically measured and referred to in increments of global average temperature rise since pre-industrial times such as 1°C, 1.5°C, and 2°C. These small-sounding numbers appear incremental but represent substantially different climates. Every increase in global temperature has implications for local and regional weather, natural systems, and society.

Before creating anything with Probable Futures data or maps, we strongly recommend reading all four volumes on [probablefutures.org](probablefutures.org/): Heat, Water, Land, and Onward. These four volumes are essential context for creating applications using Probable Futures data.

Examples of how the data can be visualized as maps may be seen in the public maps application located at [probablefutures.org/maps](probablefutures.org/maps).
