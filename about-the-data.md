# About the data

Probable Futures data are climate model data.

Climate models can be a useful tool for real-world decision-making. Before using them in this way, however, it is important to understand how scientists make the models, how they are meant to be used, and their strengths and weaknesses. This section covers these topics and will empower you to use data produced by climate models in an informed and risk-aware manner.

## What climate models do
Scientists created climate models to better understand how the climate would change in response to changes in the composition of the atmosphere. At their most basic level, these models are based on fundamental laws of physics, simulate proven physical dynamics that govern atmospheric behavior, and reproduce patterns in observed data. Climate models simulate properties and processes across the full Earth system, including land, glaciers, forests, oceans, and the atmosphere.

## Climate and weather
The climate is a set of conditions that hold over seasons and years, while weather is made up of short-term atmospheric outcomes that can change within a day. Climate is expressed in ranges and averages, while weather is a precise phenomenon at a specific time in a specific place. Climate models thus offer helpful information about the trajectory and magnitude of climate outcomes for given changes in the atmosphere, but they are not meant to make precise predictions.

## Warming scenarios
Any given change in the atmosphere toward an increasing global average temperature may be referred to as a warming scenario.

As the climate changes, the ranges and averages that can be expected at a local, regional, and global level change as well. Because the climate system is complex, an increase in global average temperature results in a wide range of changes in heat, precipitation, and dryness. Developing foresight into these wide-ranging changing conditions offers an opportunity to take action to manage the unavoidable and avoid the unmanageable range of futures we now face.

The Probable Futures data and maps offer insight into this range of probable conditions for six warming scenarios: two that are now in the past, one that is probable in the coming years, and three that are possible but currently avoidable. More warming scenarios may be added to the Probable Futures data and maps in the future.

Warming scenarios are typically measured and referred to in increments of global average temperature rise since pre-industrial times. Celsius is typically used as the unit. Changes in global average temperature of even 0.5°C represent substantially different climates. Thus, common units for warming scenarios are 1°C, 1.5°C, and 2°C. The Probable Futures warming scenarios include 0.5°C, 1°C, 1.5°C, 2°C, 2.5°C, and 3°C. These small-sounding numbers may appear incremental but every increase in global temperature has implications for local and regional weather, natural systems, and society.

## Examples of applications of the data

Examples of how the data can be visualized as maps may be seen in the public maps application located at [probablefutures.org/maps](probablefutures.org/maps).
